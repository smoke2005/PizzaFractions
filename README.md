### PizzaFractions

## Inspiration
As someone who struggled with fractions as a kid, I wanted to create a tool that turns something intimidating into something exciting. Pizza Fraction Party was born from the idea of making math feel like a game, not a test. What better way to learn fractions than by slicing up your favorite food—pizza! The goal was to help middle schoolers visualize fractions in a fun, interactive way that doesn’t feel like “studying” at all.

## What it does
Pizza Fraction Party is an interactive web-based game where players become pizza chefs! Students receive “orders” with fraction-based requirements (like ¾ mushroom and ¼ pepperoni), and they must cut the pizza into the right slices and add toppings accordingly. Correct answers trigger fun animations and popups (like a dancing pizza), while mistakes prompt helpful hints. The game helps kids practice fraction addition, conversion, and comparison - while having a blast. It even includes a whiteboard panel for calculations and a badge system for motivation.

## Gameplay and Experience

1. **Receive a Pizza Order:**  
   - The game presents you with a pizza order that involves adding two fractions (e.g., 1/2 + 1/4).

2. **Cut the Pizza:**  
   - You're asked, "Into how many equal slices should we cut the pizza?" Enter the least common denominator (LCM) for the fractions to divide the pizza into the correct number of slices.

3. **Convert Fractions:**  
   - Next, convert both fractions to have the common denominator you just entered. Fill in the equivalent numerators for each fraction (e.g., 1/2 = 2/4, 1/4 = 1/4).

4. **Add Toppings:**  
   - Drag and drop the correct number of toppings onto the pizza slices to visually represent the sum of the fractions. For example, if the sum is 3/4, place toppings on 3 out of 4 slices.

5. **Submit Your Pizza:**  
   - Click the submit button to check your answer. If correct, you'll see a celebration animation and earn points. If not, you'll get feedback and can try again.

6. **Advance to the Next Order:**  
   - After a correct answer, move on to the next randomly generated pizza order and repeat the process.

7. **Use the Whiteboard:**  
   - If you need help, use the built-in whiteboard panel to work out problems visually.

8. **Track Your Score:**  
   - Your score updates in real time as you complete orders correctly.

The game continues with new fraction challenges, helping you practice and master fraction addition in a fun, interactive way!

## How I Built It  
- **Languages & Tools**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Canvas API**: Used to render interactive, sliceable pizzas and toppings  
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Enabled for placing toppings using JavaScript event listeners  
- **Custom Order System**: Randomly generates fraction-based challenges  
- **Whiteboard Panel**: Canvas-based sketch pad for manual calculations  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the game works on tablets, laptops, and desktops

## Challenges 
I found that making the drag-and-drop toppings feel smooth and natural was trickier than expected. Ensuring the pizza slices updated correctly with every fraction problem took lots of trial and error. Balancing the game to be both fun and educational wasn’t always easy, and I had to carefully refine the feedback system to give quick responses without confusing or frustrating players.

## Accomplishments 
I'm proud to have turned fraction practice into a hands-on pizza-making experience that kids actually enjoy. The interface feels playful and welcoming, encouraging learners to keep coming back. I successfully blended coding, visuals, and math concepts into a smooth experience, and added a whiteboard tool so kids can work through problems their own way - eliminating guesswork.

## Learning
Building *Pizza Fraction Party* taught me a lot - both technically and conceptually. I learned how to combine game mechanics with core math ideas in a way that feels natural and fun. On the technical side, I deepened my skills in using assets for visual learning, fine-tuned drag-and-drop interactions, and learned how to build dynamic feedback systems. Most importantly, I discovered that when math is made visual and interactive, it becomes less scary and more inviting for learners of all levels.

## What's next for Pizza Fraction Party
- Add multiplayer “chef team” mode for collaborative math challenges  
- Introduce more topics like decimals, percentages, or measurements
